> vehicle_routing

PLEASE DESCRIBE THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD AND THE PROBLEM THAT IT SOLVES.

> 
> **Algorithmic Method Summary**  
> This submission solves a **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** variant using a hybrid approach that combines:  
>
> 1. **Adaptive, Parameterized Savings Construction**  
>    - Instead of using a fixed savings formula (as in Clarke & Wright), each node has a contribution parameter. A merge’s “score” is influenced by the sum/multiplication of the parameters for the two nodes, which can be tuned over iterations.  
>    - This lets the solver concentrate on merging certain routes more aggressively, adapting to the topology or demands.  
>
> 2. **Two-Phase Acceptance Criterion**  
>    - While striving to improve the solution cost, the algorithm sometimes accepts worse parameter configurations via an exponential acceptance function (“\(\exp(-\Delta / \text{scaling})\)”), akin to simulated annealing.  
>    - This “stochastic acceptance” allows the search to escape local minima where deterministic greedy merges might stall.  
>
> 3. **Local Search Enhancements**  
>    - **Intra-route Optimization (2-opt):** Loops through each route to remove crossing edges and reduce total distance.  
>    - **Inter-route Swaps:** Systematically tries to swap nodes across different routes—subject to capacity constraints—to capture improvements that 2-opt alone would miss.  
>    - **Relocate:** Moves single nodes between routes, evaluating each possible insertion position while respecting capacity constraints.  
>    - A specialized "best-improvement first" mechanism checks possible node swaps between routes and applies them in descending order of potential gain, maximizing benefit while avoiding conflicts. This approach allows parallelization and hence significant performance improvement in contrast with sequential solution improving.
>
> 4. **Dynamic Pruning and Early-Exit Criteria**  
>    - Uses thresholds (e.g., a “max distance / N” cutoff for merges, or an early exit if a solution’s cost is too high) to avoid fruitless merges or iterations.  
>    - Tracks stagnation (no improvement over multiple iterations) to terminate the search early.  
>
> **Problem Addressed**  
> This approach addresses **Vehicle Routing** with capacity constraints, focusing on finding cost-effective tours that collectively visit all customer nodes without exceeding vehicle capacity. By injecting an adaptive parameter into the classical savings framework and unifying it with iterative local search and a quasi-simulated annealing acceptance, it can overcome many pitfalls of purely greedy or purely metaheuristic solutions.

THE COPYRIGHT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THE ASSIGNMENT THAT YOU EXECUTE.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF ALGORITHMIC METHOD

TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD IN CODE YOU SHOULD IDENTIFY THE CODE AND SUBMIT IT AS AN EMAIL ATTACHMENT TOGETHER WITH THIS DOCUMENT.


## SECTION 3

### NOVELTY AND INVENTIVENESS

To support your claim that an algorithmic method is novel and inventive, you should provide evidence that demonstrates both its uniqueness (novelty) and its non-obviousness (inventiveness) in relation to the existing state of the art.

### Establish the State of the Art

- **Prior Art Search:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing methods, algorithms, patents, academic papers, and industry practices to identify prior art in the domain.
  - Highlight documents and technologies most closely related to your method.

    > Clarke and Wright Savings Algorithm (classic approach).
  Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search variants for VRP.
  Genetic Algorithms and other metaheuristics for VRP.

  - Show where these existing methods fall short or lack the features your algorithmic method provides.
  
    > - Rigid Parameterization: Classical savings-based heuristics do not typically allow per-node weighting that changes over iterations, limiting adaptivity. 
    > - Uncoordinated Metaheuristics: Many hybrid approaches fail to integrate a smoothly parameterized savings step with a dynamic acceptance criterion. Metaheuristics are often “bolted on” after an initial route construction, not continuously tuned.
    > - Limited Inter-Route Coordination: Some known solvers rely heavily on local searches within a single route or basic route merging, but do not systematically explore route–route swaps with a “best-improvement-first” aggregator that avoids conflicts.

- **Technical Context:** Describe the common approaches and challenges in the field prior to your innovation.

    > The VRP field has long recognized that combining constructive heuristics with iterative local search is powerful. However, constructive heuristics (like savings) typically remain static. Metaheuristics (like simulated annealing) often operate purely at the solution level, not in the parameter space of the constructive method.
    By making the savings calculation itself dynamic—guided by evolving per-node parameters—this approach smoothly unifies the initial construction and subsequent improvements, ensuring that each iteration’s constructive step remains relevant to the partial solutions discovered so far.

### Evidence of Novelty

- **Unique Features:** List the features, mechanisms, or aspects of your algorithmic method that are absent in prior art.

Here's the corrected text:

> 1. Parametric Savings Factor  
>    - Each node i is assigned a parameter (Bl <= param_i <= Bh), where Bl and Bh are lower and upper bounds of parameters.  
>    - Merges are scored as (param_i + param_j)*(distance_out_and_back - distance_merge).  
>    - Dynamically altering these parameters over iterations is uncommon in standard VRP heuristics.  
>
> 2. Stochastic Acceptance for Parameter Changes  
>    - The code calculates a cost delta (`Δ`) when switching from current parameters to new ones and decides acceptance based on `exp(-Δ / scale)`.  
>    - This type of acceptance is rarely seen integrated directly into a savings-based approach.  
>
> 3. Selective Pairwise Merging  
>    - The algorithm uses a distance threshold to skip merges that are unlikely to be beneficial and reduce search space.  
>    - This targeted pruning is more efficient than blindly computing all pairwise merges.  
>
> 4. Iterated Postprocessing  
>    - After constructing or updating the solution, 2-opt, route-route swaps and relocates are run repeatedly until no improvement is found.  
>    - Inter-route swaps and relocate operator are aggregated in a single pass and applied in rank order, avoiding conflicts—this differs from many solutions that check swaps one by one and accept or reject them on the spot. 
    
- **New Problem Solved:** Describe how your algorithmic method provides a novel solution to an existing problem.

  > The algorithm addresses the problem of **adaptively tuning the classical savings construction** to suit the problem instance’s capacity and spatial/demand distributions. It extends standard local searches to keep pace with the new solutions generated by parameter changes, ensuring that the final solution benefits from both flexible construction and thorough refinement.  
    
- **Comparative Analysis:** Use a side-by-side comparison table to highlight the differences between your method and similar existing methods, clearly showing what’s new.
