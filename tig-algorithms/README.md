# tig-algorithms

A Rust crate that hosts algorithm submissions made by Innovators in TIG.

Each submissions is committed to their own branch with the naming pattern:

`<challenge_name>\<algorithm_name>`

# Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tig-foundation/tig-monorepo
    ```

2. Create an algorithm
   * Create your algorithm file `tig-algorithms/src/satisfiability/my_algo.rs` and copy/paste [this code](https://github.com/tig-foundation/tig-monorepo/blob/test/satisfiability/schnoing/tig-algorithms/src/satisfiability/schnoing/benchmarker_outbound.rs)
   * Edit `tig-algorithms/src/satisfiability/mod.rs` and add the line:
   ```
   pub mod my_algo;
   ```

3. Compile your algorithm:
    ```
    cd tig-monorepo

    CHALLENGE=satisfiability
    VERSION=0.0.1
    docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/tig-foundation/tig-monorepo/$CHALLENGE/dev:$VERSION

    # inside docker
    build_algorithm my_algo
    ```

4. Test your algorithm:
    ```
    # inside docker
    test_algorithm my_algo [100,300]
    ```
    * Use `--help` to see more options
    * Use `--verbose` to dump individual instance commands that you can run. Example:
    ```
    /usr/local/bin/tig-runtime '{"algorithm_id":"","challenge_id":"c001","difficulty":[50,300],"block_id":"","player_id":""}' rand_hash 99 ./tig-algorithms/lib/satisfiability/arm64/my_algo.so --fuel 100000000000
    ```

5. Submitting your algorithm to Testnet:
    * Add and edit the following license header to `my_algo.rs`:
    ```
    /*!
    Copyright [year copyright work created] [name of copyright owner]

    Identity of Submitter [name of person or entity that submits the Work to TIG]

    ```

    * See [Attributing Advances](#attributing-advances) for how to set UAI field
    * Visit https://test.tig.foundation/innovation/submission and follow the instructions
    * Each new address on testnet gets 10 TIG balance
    * Algorithms on testnet can be used straight away after they are successfully compiled

6. Try benchmarking! See [Benchmarking Quick Start](../tig-benchmarker/README.md#quick-start)

# Developer Environment

We recommend developing using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Rust plugins:
* rust-analyzer
* Even Better TOML
* crates
* CodeLLDB

# Improving Algorithms

All algorithms in TIG are open! You can develop your own de-novo algorithm or improve upon existing ones. 

**Tip:** there is a `tig-algorithms/src/<challenge>/template.rs` for each challenge. Inside it contains valuable tips on how to make your algorithm deterministic. Determinism is important in TIG because results need to be reproducible by everyone!

## Challenge Descriptions

See the [README in tig-challenges](../tig-challenges/README.md) for links to descriptions for each challenge.

## Obtaining Code

Every algorithm has its own `<branch>` with name `<challenge_name>/<algorithm_name>`. You should visit [the repository](https://github.com/tig-foundation/tig-monorepo) to look at code submitted by other Innovators (look in `tig-algorithm/src/<challenge_name>/<algorithm_name>`).

## Compiling & Testing Your Algorithm

See [Quick Start](README.md#quick-start)

## Testing Existing Algorithms

TIG has a [dev docker image](../README.md#docker-images) for each challenge. To test an existing algorithm, you can edit & follow this example:

```
CHALLENGE=satisfiability
VERSION=0.0.1
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/tig-foundation/tig-monorepo/$CHALLENGE/dev:$VERSION

# inside docker
list_algorithms --testnet
download_algorithm sat_global_opt --testnet
test_algorithm sat_global_opt [1000,300]
```

# GPU Algorithms

For challenges `vector_search` and `hypergraph`, a GPU with CUDA 12.6.3+ is required.

Additionally, you will need to run your docker with `--gpus all` option. Example:

```
CHALLENGE=vector_search
VERSION=0.0.1
docker run -it --gpus all -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/tig-foundation/tig-monorepo/$CHALLENGE/dev:$VERSION

# inside docker
nvidia-smi
```

To be competitive in these challenges, you should develop cuda kernels in a `.cu` file which can be launched from your rust `.rs` code.

# Attributing Advances

Innovators in TIG can also [submit advances](../tig-advances/README.md) (algorithmic methods).

If your implementation is based on an advance that has been submitted to TIG, you must attribute your implementation to it (example UAI: `c001_b001`)
* UAI of a method is detailed inside `tig-advances/<challenge_name>/<method_name>.md`
* If your implementation is based on an algorithmic method outside of TIG, set UAI to `null`

# License

Each algorithm submission will have 5 versions, each under a specific license:

* `commercial` will be under TIG commercial license
* `open_data` will be under TIG open data license
* `benchmarker_outbound` will be under TIG benchmarker outbound license
* `innovator_outbound` will be under TIG innovator outbound license
* `inbound` will be under TIG inbound license
