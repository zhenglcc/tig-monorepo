# tig-algorithms

A Rust crate that hosts algorithm submissions (code and advances) made by Innovators in TIG.

Submissions are committed to their own branch with the naming pattern:

`<challenge_name>\<algorithm_name>` 

Code submissions will have a Rust implementation at:

`src/<challenge_name>/<algorithm_name>/benchmarker_outbound.rs`

Advance submissions will have a Markdown file at:

`advances/<challenge_name>/<algorithm_name>.md`
