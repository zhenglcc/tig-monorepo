**EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF A REQUEST FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR ADVANCE REWARDS**

## INTRODUCTION

* TIG TOKEN HOLDERS WILL VOTE ON WHETHER YOUR **ALGORITHMIC METHOD** IS ELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCE REWARDS.  
    
* TIG TOKEN HOLDERS ARE FREE TO VOTE AS THEY LIKE BUT HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT IN MOST INSTANCES, IF THEY WANT TO MAXIMISE THE VALUE OF THE TOKENS THAT THEY HOLD, THEN THEY SHOULD BE SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT ALGORITHMIC METHODS THAT THEY VOTE AS ELIGIBLE WILL BE **BOTH** NOVEL AND INVENTIVE.  
    
* THE REASON WHY NOVELTY AND INVENTIVENESS ARE IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PREREQUISITES OF PATENTABILITY AND PATENTS WILL ADD VALUE TO THE TOKENS BY PROVIDING A CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST FREERIDERS IF THE PATENTS ARE INFRINGED.  
    
* **THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS TO:**

  * CAPTURE A DESCRIPTION OF THE SINGLE, DISCRETE **ALGORITHMIC METHOD** THAT YOU WANT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ELIGIBILITY.  
      
  * IDENTIFY THE CREATOR OF THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD.

  * PROMPT YOU TO PROVIDE THE BEST EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE CASE THAT THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD IS NOVEL AND INVENTIVE.

  * PROMPT YOU TO PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR ANY TECHNICAL EFFECTS AND REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS OF YOUR ALGORITHMIC METHOD WHERE YOU CAN.

WHEN PROVIDING EVIDENCE, YOU MAY CITE LINKS TO EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES.

***NOTE:** TO HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EVIDENCE IS REQUIRED WE HAVE PREPARED THE [**ADVANCE REWARDS GUIDELINES**](./guidelines.pdf). PLEASE READ BEFORE COMPLETING THIS TEMPLATE.*

**IMPORTANT: NOTE THAT YOUR SUBMITTED METHOD (AS DEFINED IN THE GUIDELINES \*) REFERS TO A DISCRETE METHOD. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE SPECIFICATION OR IMPLEMENTATION THAT YOU SUBMIT TO THE INNOVATION GAME FOR SOLVING A RELEVANT CHALLENGE, EMBODIES MORE THAN ONE INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMIC METHOD. IN SUCH CASES, YOU SHOULD SELECT THE SINGLE DISCRETE METHOD THAT YOU BELIEVE WILL GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS WHEN SUBJECTED TO A TOKEN HOLDER VOTE FOR ADVANCE REWARD ELIGIBILITY, AND COMPLETE THIS EVIDENCE TEMPLATE WITH RESPECT TO THAT METHOD ONLY (IF YOUR SPECIFICATION OR IMPLEMENTATION EMBODIES MORE THAN ONE DISCRETE INNOVATIVE METHOD PLEASE ALSO DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE METHODS ARE IN SECTION 1 FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES).**

**\* “Method”: means a discrete algorithmic method that is a finite, abstract, and well-defined sequence of steps or operations, formulated to solve a specific problem or compute a result, independent of any programming language or execution environment. A code implementation of a Method, by contrast, is the realization of that Method in a specific programming language or system. For instance, two implementations of Dijkstra’s method in C++ and Java might differ in syntax and performance quirks, but they would still embody the same core method.**

**WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SELECTED METHOD, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW:**

**STEP 1:** IDENTIFY ANY **TECHNICAL EFFECTS** OF EXECUTING THE METHOD. \[SEE SLIDE 6 OF THE ADVANCE REWARDS GUIDELINES\].

**STEP 2:** IDENTIFY THE **FIELD** IN WHICH THE METHOD IS TO BE ASSESSED FOR INVENTIVENESS \[*SEE SLIDE 7* OF THE ADVANCE REWARDS GUIDELINES\].

**STEP 3**: SEARCH FOR AND IDENTIFY **PRIOR ART** THAT MAY IMPACT NOVELTY AND INVENTIVENESS.

**STEP 4:** CONSIDER **NOVELTY**. ESTABLISH THE NOVELTY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD. \[SEE SLIDE 8 OF THE ADVANCE REWARDS GUIDELINES\].

**STEP 5**: BENCHMARK YOUR METHOD USING **TEST DATASETS** \[*SEE SLIDE 9* OF THE ADVANCE REWARDS GUIDELINES\].

**STEP 6**: CONSIDER **INVENTIVENESS** \[*SEE SLIDES 10-16* OF THE ADVANCE REWARDS GUIDELINES\].

  * **TEACHING AWAY IN PRIOR ART:** DOES PRIOR WORK SUGGEST THAT YOUR APPROACH WOULD NOT WORK OR WASN’T THE BEST DIRECTION?

  * **LONG-FELT NEED**: HAS THE FIELD STRUGGLED WITH THE PROBLEM THAT YOU ARE SOLVING FOR A WHILE, AND YOU SOLVED IT ?  
      
  * **POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL ADOPTION:** IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT YOUR METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SEE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OR WIDE ADOPTION ?  
      
  * **MOTIVATION:** WOULD A POSITA, FACING THE SAME PROBLEM, HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED TO TRY YOUR SOLUTION, AND REASONABLY HAVE EXPECTED IT TO WORK ?

  * **TEACHING OR SUGGESTION**: WOULD THE PRIOR ART SUGGEST TO OR TEACH A POSITA A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS PATH TO YOUR METHOD ?  
      
  * **EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS**: WOULD A POSITA HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF THE SUCCESS OF YOUR METHOD?

**Appendix A**

**Appendix B**

| Category | Evidence |
| :---: | ----- |
| **A** | **New Method or Method new to Field:** The newness of the Method or novelty in the Field should make overcoming obviousness relatively easy providing the Method solves the problem with a reasonable level of performance. If a method offering a reasonable level of performance would be obvious to a POSITA then they would likely have already tried it and the fact that they haven’t suggests it is therefore not obvious. Relevant evidence will therefore be an Unexpected Result (we suggest equal to or greater than 50% of the performance of the SOTA method) from benchmarking.  |
| **B** | **Combination with prior art from outside the Field:** You should provide evidence that it would not be obvious for a POSITA to discover the prior art from the other field and combine it with prior art in the Field. You should also provide supporting evidence of commercial value or utility; the more evidence of this that you can provide the less likely it will be that the combination will be deemed to be obvious (commercial value or utility provides a source of motivation for the creation of the Method which a POSITA would be assumed to have responded to already if it was obvious to do so). Evidence of an Unexpected Result, as above, will be relevant for Methods in this Category too.  |
| **C** | **Method based on prior art seen in the Field applied to produce a Technical Effect also seen in the Field but not previously associated with the Method:** A POSITA will be deemed to have knowledge of the prior art in the Field and the nature of the Technical Effect. You should provide evidence that it would not be obvious for a POSITA to achieve the Technical Effect using the Method. You should also provide supporting evidence of commercial value or utility; the more evidence of this that you can provide the less likely it will be that the application will be deemed to be obvious (commercial value or utility provides a source of motivation for the creation of the Method which a POSITA would be assumed to have responded to already if it was obvious to do so). Relevant evidence will therefore be an Unexpected Result (we suggest equal to or greater than the performance of the SOTA method) from benchmarking.  |
| **D** | **Prior art from same field combined in a new way:** A POSITA will be deemed to have knowledge of the prior art. If an improved outcome based on prior art known to the POSITA would be obvious, they would likely have tried it. The most compelling evidence of non-obviousness will therefore be an Unexpected Result (we suggest equal to or greater than the performance of the SOTA method) from benchmarking. You should also provide supporting evidence of commercial value or utility; the more evidence of this that you can provide the less likely it will be that the combination will be deemed to be obvious (commercial value or utility provides a source of motivation for the creation of the Method which a POSITA would be assumed to have responded to already if it was obvious to do so).  |
| **E** | **Method incorporates prior art seen in the Field applied in a new way within the Method (i.e. the application of the prior art to solve a mathematical problem or subset of a mathematical problem in a way for which there is no known precedent):** A POSITA will be deemed to have knowledge of the mathematical method and so you should provide supporting evidence that it would not be obvious for a POSITA to apply the mathematical method to solve the relevant problem in the way that your Method does. If an improved outcome based on prior art known to the POSITA would be obvious, they would likely have tried it and the fact that they haven’t suggests it is therefore not obvious. As with Category D, the most compelling evidence of non-obviousness will be an Unexpected Result (we suggest equal to or greater than the performance of the SOTA method) from benchmarking. As for Category D, you should also provide supporting evidence of commercial value or utility.  |
